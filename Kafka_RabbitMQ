A Kafka broker is a Kafka server that allows producers to stream data to consumers. The Kafka broker contains topics and their respective partitions. 
A topic is data storage that groups similar data in a Kafka broker. 
A partition is smaller data storage within a topic that consumers subscribe to. 
ZooKeeper is special software that manages the Kafka clusters and partitions to provide fault-tolerant streaming. ZooKeeper has recently been replaced with the Apache Kafka Raft (KRaft) protocol.

Topic -> Partition -> 


In RabbitMQ, the producer sends and monitors if the message reaches the intended consumer. On the other hand,
Kafka producers publish messages to the queue regardless of whether consumers have retrieved them.
